<p>Our team is implementing a database for the Course Assessment using Data
Exploration of Text (CADET) project. Datasets containing course assessment
comments and metadata will be able to be stored for future use. Users will no
longer need to re-upload files each time they wish to analyze a particular set
of data.</p>
<p>This feature will request the program to run a sentiment analysis report for a
particular, unprocessed dataset given as a parameter (Dataset ID). This
operation will be performed via calls to a <a class="citation-reference" href="#restful" id="id1">[RESTful]</a> API described in
specification <a class="citation-reference" href="#d82" id="id2">[D82]</a>. Other parameters include: number of topics, words per
topic, and number of iterations. The datasets being passed into the sentiment
analysis module will be retrieved from the database using the ID of the
dataset. The results of the analysis will be stored in the database. If a
query contains the same paramaters as one previously stored in the database,
the results of the previous analysis will immediately be returned.</p>
<div class="section" id="problem-description">
<h1>Problem Description</h1>
<p>Previously, files containing comments were uploaded and were directly
transmitted to the comment analysis module. Here, they are processed and the
results are reported back to the user. Because a database is being
implemented, the analysis module can no longer receive data in this way. The
datasets must now be retrieved from the database and passed to the analysis
module, and a new interface is needed to support this change.</p>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Retrieve a specified dataset from the database</li>
<li>Return and cache results of sentiment analysis</li>
<li>If a specified dataset is not found, return a &quot;404 Not Found&quot; error with a
description of the invalid request</li>
<li>If an exception occurs during the analysis, return a &quot;500 Server Error&quot;</li>
<li>Retrieve and return cached results if the analysis has been done in the past</li>
<li>Same output data as current implementation</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-cases">
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The user requests a report on a specified course from a specific year. The
data is located in the database. A report request is called and the dataset is
analyzed. The processed data is passed on to be presented to the user. The
data is also stored in the database for future use.</li>
<li>The user wishes to see a report for a previously processed dataset, but did
not save the results. The previous report is cached in the database. The user
again requests the report and is immediately returned the results without the
need to re-process the dataset.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proposed-change">
<h1>Proposed Change</h1>
<p>This feature is the bridge between the newly implemented database and the
current analysis module. A separate table of the database will contain sets of
specified comments. This table will have an auto-incremented integer serving as
the ID for each dataset.</p>
<p>This feature will take the following parameters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Dataset ID:         The ID of the stored set of comments</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Number of Topics:   The number of topics (each topic is a set of related</dt>
<dd>words found in comments) specified by the user</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Words per Topic:    The number of related words in a single topic</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Iterations:         The number of iterations of <a class="citation-reference" href="#lda" id="id3">[LDA]</a> process (for topic</dt>
<dd>analysis)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Dataset ID is not found in the database, a &quot;404 Not Found&quot; error will
be returned. Before an unnecessary analysis is performed, this feature will
check if there is a cached result of this report by comparing the parameters
passed in this call to those stored in the cached results.</p>
<p>If this report has not been produced before, the dataset table will be
accessed, and the comments in the specified set will be passed through the
analysis module using the rest of the parameters provided in the call. The
sentiment of each comment is set by the analysis module. Each comment is
determined to be positive, negative, or neutral. If any error occurs during
the processing, a &quot;500 Server Error&quot; will be returned.</p>
<p>A list of JSON objects will be returned to the user and will also be cached in
the database. The Work Items section covers the format of the results.</p>
<div class="section" id="alternatives">
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>An alternative would be to stay with the status quo. In this case, a database
would not be used. The comments would instead be stored locally.</p>
<p>The planned implementation provides the ability to cache results and, thanks
to the metadata being stored, lays the groundwork for more complex queries in
the future. Future additions could allow the filtering of comments included in
datasets by using the metadata being stored.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>Testing will involve attempting to access valid and invalid datasets. The
Proposed Changes section describes the expected result of attempting to access
an invalid dataset. Valid accesses should produce the same results as the
current implementation of the project. The results will be tested against
this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>The documentation should describe the parameters being passed into the
function and the format of the returned objects. Inline comments will be used
to describe the actions being taken. These will appear in block comment form
above the function. Smaller comments will be used to explain more complex
operations that may not be wholly self-documented.</p>
<p>Information about the HTTP status codes should be included in the
documentation covering the whole API for this project. This documentation
should also include how to request reports and the expected return value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementation">
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<div class="section" id="work-items">
<h2>Work Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Access Database</p>
<p>The Dataset ID will be used to fetch the comments to be processed. The
cached results will be accessed to check if a report for this dataset,
with matching parameters, has been run previously.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Format Data</p>
<p>The data will need to be re-formatted to match the current input expected
by the analysis module.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Sentiment Analysis</p>
<p>This phase will remain the same as the current implementation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Format Results</p>
<p>The results of the analysis will also need to be re-formatted. The results
will contain:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Topic Model Dictionary</li>
<li>List of Comment Objects</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Topic Model will be a dictionary that uses the Topic ID stored in the
comment object as a key that matches a comment to a list of related words.
This list of words is known as a topic.</p>
<p>The comment objects will contain these fields:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Comment</li>
<li>Comment ID</li>
<li>Comment Type</li>
<li>Course</li>
<li>Instructor First Name</li>
<li>Instructor Last Name</li>
<li>Sentiment of Comment</li>
<li>Topic ID</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Return and Cache Results</p>
<p>The results will be store in the database, waiting to be retrieved by the
presentation layer team. The analysis cache will contain the following for
each report:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Number of Topics</li>
<li>Words Per Topic</li>
<li>Iterations</li>
<li>Result Set</li>
</ul>

<p>The CADET project will aim to port the existing desktop user interface to a web
application.  This will require two teams; one to focus on using Django to
transition to a web based user interface and a second back end team which will
focus on data processing/storage using Natural Language Tools (NLT). The web
portal will allow users to upload end of semester comments in order to
make the sorting / viewing and analysis faster and more intuitive for the user.
One identified feature necessary to achieve the stated goal is the display
topic comments from data layer feature outlined in the title.  This feature
is the important middle man involved in receiving processed data from the data
layer team and making it intuitively available for the interface.  Specifically
from the processed student comment file making the topic groups and associated
comments accessible for display to the user.</p>
<div class="section" id="problem-description">
<h1>Problem Description</h1>
<p>At the end of each semester John Hopkins University distributes surveys to
students in order to gain an understanding of instructor performance.  These
surveys are also shared with the professors in order to help give feedback for
the instructors to act on.  The problem is in the quantity of comments which
can become too large for a single professor to effectively utilize. In order to
meet this, a need for CADET was developed.  The program uses the Natural
Language Toolkit (NLT) in order to sort comments by word clusters and by
sentiment.  These groupings allow an instructor to parse through smaller groups
of like data in order to better understand and process the comments they are
receiving. Making this desktop interface available as a web application
addresses a current issue with the lack of accessibility faculty currently have
to this functionality. As addressed, porting this application to a web
interface will require two teams; front and back end teams.  It is important to
consider the implementation of the key features in order to ensure
functionality is maintained.  One key function identified which will be
affected by the separation of the back end and front end is the ability to take
the processed data and present the information to the User Interface (UI) for
intuitive and fast retrieval in order to support in the implementation to view
comments.</p>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>The display topic comments feature will take the Data Layer Team output, a JSON
object, as an input and will present to the dashboard a class object in order
to easily pull specific information properly.  The JSON file will include the
original CSV information, reformatted, and include NLTK analysis; additionally
the retuned object will have an associated Primary Key in order to reference
the database. On the front end a user will see this information reflected in a
graph.  The NLTK analysis will use natural language processing to pull out
identifying terms and categories for comments. Each category will have a set of
identifying words which is dependent on the users desired number of groupings.
These categories and associated sentiment analysis will be displayed to the
user. The user will have the ability to select a group of these identifiers
which will direct to a display of the comments associated with the selection.
This web portal will be used across multiple browsers to include Chrome and
Firefox.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-case-a">
<h2>Use Case A:</h2>
<p>Who:  Course instructor.
Actors' goals:  Professor hopes to view comments in order to see what students
noted about her/his class and hopes to look at some of the specific comments
students left.
Preconditions:  Professor has student comments file on computer for accessing,
and will upload the file in the proper file format to the web interface
before using the Dashboard - Display topic across comments.  The user will also
select the number of topics to be grouped, the number of student comments per-
topics and number of iterations.
Main functions: Upon hitting the enter button the user will be brought to a
main screen where there will be topic buttons based on the number of desired
topics.  Each button will be associated with one of the determined word
clusters.  By clicking on one of the word clusters that group of associated
comments will be displayed.
Variations: The professor could want to select multiple word grouping and the
application could highlight the appropriate out of the full list but instead we
have chosen to only allow one selection at a time and display only the
comment associated with that selection.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-case-b">
<h2>Use Case B:</h2>
<p>Who:  Department Head.
Actors' Goals:  The Department Head would like to look at an instructor's
performance over the course of a semester.
Preconditions:  The Department Head has comment file for an instructor on
computer for accessing, and will upload in the proper file format to the web
interface before using the Dashboard - Display topic across comment. The user
will also select the number of topics to be grouped, the number of comments
per topics and number of iterations.
Main functions: Upon hitting the enter button the user will be brought to a
main screen where there will be topic buttons based on the number of desired
topics.  Each button will be associated with one of the determined word
clusters.  The Department Head cares less about the individual teacher's
comments but prefers the overall sentiment graphs.  In order to do this the
user then must look on the left side of the screen where there is a navigation
bar that will enable the user to switch to the Dashboard - Display common
sentiments extracted from data layer.
Variations: The Department Head could accidently exit out of the system in
which case he would navigate back to the URL where he would have to start from
the beginning of the preconditions.  This is the best way to handle this
variation as there should be no way to let other see what the Department Head
was looking at last and the process to view the result is painless.</p>

<p>This feature will feed the UI Dashboard - &quot;Display topic comments from data

required to display for the user.  In order for this integration to be useful
the features designer must be plugged in with the overall UI development and be
prepared to support the UI designer in this portion of the dashboard. The dash
board will utilize buttons with associated display word clusters, when selected
these buttons will cause the frame to fill with the associated comments. In
order to maintain a frame that fits the page a scroll bar will be used in the
frame to view all comments.  Above the frame there will be the ability to
switch to the Dashboard - Display common sentiments extracted from data layer.</p>
