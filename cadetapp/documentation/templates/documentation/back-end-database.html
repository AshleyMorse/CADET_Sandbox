			<p>Course Assessment using Data Exploration of Text (CADET) is a tool which uses
				natural language processing to analyze student course feedback.  The automated
				tool is able to process large datasets, categorize comments by sentiment and
			topic as well as course and instructor.</p>
			<p>CADET requires a back-end database to store submitted data for later analysis
				and retrieval.  Through implementation of a database, source data files will
				not need to be re-uploaded and re-analyzed in order to be viewed a second
			time or by a second person reviewing the same data.</p>
			<div class="section" id="problem-description">
				<h1>Problem Description</h1>
				<p>The current implementation of CADET has no memory of previous data sets.  As
					such, data must be re-analyzed each time it is to be reviewed.  Also, all data
					for a particular analysis case must be processed at the same time in order to
				review any particular set of data.</p>
				<div class="section" id="requirements">
					<h2>Requirements</h2>
					<ul class="simple">
						<li>Functional Requirements:<ul>
							<li>The back-end database will provide a simple and intuitive structure for
								storing and retrieving data in order to assist with the overall behavior
							and usability of the CADET system.</li>
							<li>The database should be responsive and properly indexed in order to
								provide result sets quickly.<ul>
									<li>Lack of indexing within large datasets could force the database to
										perform mutliple full-table scans when attempting to query for a
									particular set of data filtered by un-indexed columns.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>The database should also facilitate prevention of duplicate raw data in
								case an end-user attempts to upload/ingest a file that has already been
								processed.<ul>
									<li>Allowing duplicate data could potentially skew results of the analysis
									and produce inaccurate results; ostesibly corrupting the data.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>The database will add to the overall flexibility of the system, and
								specificially the available data and interactions with the front-end as
								presented to the end-user.<ul>
									<li>Providing the ability to analyze across single-file datasets allows for
									a more broad scope analysis of datasets over time.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Quality Requirements:<ul>
						<li>The database should facilitate and not impede the natural language
						processing functions of the CADET application.</li>
						<li>Introducing a database into the project will allow for future ehancement
							of capabilities based on the ability to combine and correlate disparate
						sets of raw data.</li>

<h1>Proposed Change</h1>
<p>Initial design of the database will include five tables as described below.  A
new class will be implemented to provide a layer of abstraction between the
database and other modules required to interact with the data.  <a class="citation-reference" href="#sqlalchemy" id="id1">[SQLAlchemy]</a>
will be used to interact with the underlying <a class="citation-reference" href="#sqlite" id="id2">[SQLite]</a> database, which
provides an extra layer of abstraction as well as future capability to move to
a more robust Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).</p>
<p>Constraints defined within the data definition of the database tables will
enforce data rules, such as relationships to foreign keys or that a specific
column contains unique data, throughout the table. Since the RDBMS will
enforce these constraints, it will then be necessary to verify that the
constraints will not be violated prior to data insertion, or else the database
will throw an error that will subsequently need to be handled.</p>
<p>Instructors will uniquely identify each instructor for which the database
contains data (comments).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Instructors<ul>
<li>Primary Key</li>
<li>First Name</li>
<li>Last Name</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Courses will uniquely identify each course for which the database contains
data (comments).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Courses<ul>
<li>Primary Key</li>
<li>Department</li>
<li>Program</li>
<li>Course</li>
<li>Section</li>
<li>Year</li>
<li>Semester [1,2,3]</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;comments&quot; table will hold the raw data and associate to the metadata once
received from the front-end and parsed.  A primary, auto-increment, integer
key will be defined as a matter of convention.  A comment field will be
required as this is specifically the data we are tasked to store and
process.  Optional metadata fields will be provided for:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Comments<ul>
<li>Primary Key</li>
<li>anonimized user id</li>
<li>Comment</li>
<li>Course (foreign key: Courses.id)</li>
<li>Instructor (foreign key: Instructors.id)</li>
<li>Instructor or Course (boolean to identify the target of comment)</li>
<li>timestamp (date/time of initial ingestion of data)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Stop words will retain a unique list of stop words.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Stop Words<ul>
<li>Primary Key</li>
<li>Stop Word (unique constraint)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;datasets&quot; table will keep track of which datasets (unique combinations
of comments) have been imported.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Datasets<ul>
<li>Primary Key</li>
<li>Create Date</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A &quot;Comment Dataset&quot; table will keep track of which comments are associated
to which datasets; a potential many-to-many relationship:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Comment Dataset<ul>
<li>Primary Key</li>
<li>Comment ID (foreign key: Comments.id)</li>
<li>Dataset ID (foreign key: Datasets.id)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Results cache will store both the query (criteria) and results of any analysis
performed by the Natural Language Processing engine.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Results Cache<ul>
<li>Primary Key</li>
<li>Number of Topics</li>
<li>Words per Topic</li>
<li>Iterations</li>
<li>Stop Words</li>
<li>timestamp (date/time of analysis)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;Result Topics&quot; table will maintain the associated topics for a particular
result set:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Result Topics<ul>
<li>Primary Key</li>
<li>Result ID (foreign key: Result Cache.id)</li>
<li>Topic</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;Result Details&quot; table will maintain the comments and associated
sentiments for a particular dataset:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Result Details<ul>
<li>Primary key</li>
<li>Result ID (foreign key: Result Cache.id)</li>
<li>Comment ID (foreign key: Comment.id)</li>
<li>Sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The &quot;Topic Words&quot; table associates the specific words identified, per topic,
by the analysis process:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Topic Words<ul>
<li>Primary Key</li>
<li>Topic ID (foreign key: Result Topic.id)</li>
<li>Word</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="alternatives">
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>The current implementation does not store data from one analysis run to the
next, which means that data must be re-analyzed in order to be reviewed again
at a later date or by another person.  Given the intensive processing that
must be accomplished to analyze a single data-set, 10 minutes based on one
report, maintaining this status quo is not appropriate for a server-based,
multi-user web-based application.</p>
<p>Another alternative could be to store data files and result sets on the
filesystem.  The current system does this with the &quot;stop words&quot; list, and the
filesystem may be an appropriate place for a simple list that simply needs to
be read over and over again without changing.  What becomes prohibitively
challenging, when storing flat files on the filesystem, is the lack of meta-
data and the inability to perform complex queries.  Correlating disparate
or co-mingled data-sets would be incredibly challenging and memory-intensive
if all files had to be read and scrutinized each time a query was received
from the presentation-layer.  A database is naturally suited to perform such
activities.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>Testing should include verification of column constraints and proper handling
if those constraints are violated (such as a column with a &quot;unique&quot; index).
This can be tested by attempting to ingest the same file (and values) more
than once.</p>
<p>Testing should verify that input is properly validated and sanitized prior
to insertion in order to prevent potential SQL injection or other undesired
behavior. This can be tested by ingesting data containing SQL in an attempt
to manipulate data outside the scope of the data being ingested.</p>
<p>Code should check and enforce field size constraints to avoid undesired
behavior.  Undesired behavior could be statement failure, or silently
truncating the inserted data (depending on database configuration).  This can
be tested by inserting very large segments of data.</p>
<p>Code will be reviewed by other members of the CADET team, as well as the
documentation team, for consistency and accuracy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>End-users do not need to be aware of the internal structures of the database.
Similarly, the presentation-layer does not need to be concerned with the
specific design of the database either, except with regard to the capabilities
it is able to provide, since there will be several layers of abstraction in
between.  Documentation will primarily consist of descriptions of the
entities, data types, and associated constraints.  Programmers documentation
will describe the methods defined in the class, to include input parameters
and output parameters.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementation">
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<div class="section" id="work-items">
<h2>Work Items</h2>
<p>The database and tables will need to be created, along with user credentials
provided to the person implementing the data connector.</p>
<p>The connector, which will establish the connection to the database, will be
defined once and called when necessary to interact with the database.</p>
<p>Functions should be written to provide a layer of abstraction for specific
interactions with the database.  By centralizing and abstracting the calls to
the database, other modules (and developers) do not have to be intimately
familiar with the database design and constraints.</p>
<p>When data cannot be inserted because it violates some defined data constraint,
or cannot be retrieved because it does not exist, then an appropriate failure
response should be returned instead.  An overall database failure will also
result in a boolean 'false' returned.</p>
