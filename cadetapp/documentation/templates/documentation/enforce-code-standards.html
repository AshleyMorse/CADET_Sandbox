<p>Our team is implementing a database for the Course Assessment using Data
Exploration of Text (CADET) project. Datasets containing course assessment
comments and metadata will be able to be stored for future use. Users will no
longer need to re-upload files each time they wish to analyze a particular set
of data.</p>
<p>This feature will request the program to run a sentiment analysis report for a
particular, unprocessed dataset given as a parameter (Dataset ID). This
operation will be performed via calls to a <a class="citation-reference" href="#restful" id="id1">[RESTful]</a> API described in
specification <a class="citation-reference" href="#d82" id="id2">[D82]</a>. Other parameters include: number of topics, words per
topic, and number of iterations. The datasets being passed into the sentiment
analysis module will be retrieved from the database using the ID of the
dataset. The results of the analysis will be stored in the database. If a
query contains the same paramaters as one previously stored in the database,
the results of the previous analysis will immediately be returned.</p>
<div class="section" id="problem-description">
<h1>Problem Description</h1>
<p>Previously, files containing comments were uploaded and were directly
transmitted to the comment analysis module. Here, they are processed and the
results are reported back to the user. Because a database is being
implemented, the analysis module can no longer receive data in this way. The
datasets must now be retrieved from the database and passed to the analysis
module, and a new interface is needed to support this change.</p>
<div class="section" id="requirements">
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Retrieve a specified dataset from the database</li>
<li>Return and cache results of sentiment analysis</li>
<li>If a specified dataset is not found, return a &quot;404 Not Found&quot; error with a
description of the invalid request</li>
<li>If an exception occurs during the analysis, return a &quot;500 Server Error&quot;</li>
<li>Retrieve and return cached results if the analysis has been done in the past</li>
<li>Same output data as current implementation</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-cases">
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The user requests a report on a specified course from a specific year. The
data is located in the database. A report request is called and the dataset is
analyzed. The processed data is passed on to be presented to the user. The
data is also stored in the database for future use.</li>
<li>The user wishes to see a report for a previously processed dataset, but did
not save the results. The previous report is cached in the database. The user
again requests the report and is immediately returned the results without the
need to re-process the dataset.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="proposed-change">
<h1>Proposed Change</h1>
<p>This feature is the bridge between the newly implemented database and the
current analysis module. A separate table of the database will contain sets of
specified comments. This table will have an auto-incremented integer serving as
the ID for each dataset.</p>
<p>This feature will take the following parameters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Dataset ID:         The ID of the stored set of comments</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Number of Topics:   The number of topics (each topic is a set of related</dt>
<dd>words found in comments) specified by the user</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Words per Topic:    The number of related words in a single topic</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Iterations:         The number of iterations of <a class="citation-reference" href="#lda" id="id3">[LDA]</a> process (for topic</dt>
<dd>analysis)</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Dataset ID is not found in the database, a &quot;404 Not Found&quot; error will
be returned. Before an unnecessary analysis is performed, this feature will
check if there is a cached result of this report by comparing the parameters
passed in this call to those stored in the cached results.</p>
<p>If this report has not been produced before, the dataset table will be
accessed, and the comments in the specified set will be passed through the
analysis module using the rest of the parameters provided in the call. The
sentiment of each comment is set by the analysis module. Each comment is
determined to be positive, negative, or neutral. If any error occurs during
the processing, a &quot;500 Server Error&quot; will be returned.</p>
<p>A list of JSON objects will be returned to the user and will also be cached in
the database. The Work Items section covers the format of the results.</p>
<div class="section" id="alternatives">
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>An alternative would be to stay with the status quo. In this case, a database
would not be used. The comments would instead be stored locally.</p>
<p>The planned implementation provides the ability to cache results and, thanks
to the metadata being stored, lays the groundwork for more complex queries in
the future. Future additions could allow the filtering of comments included in
datasets by using the metadata being stored.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>Testing will involve attempting to access valid and invalid datasets. The
Proposed Changes section describes the expected result of attempting to access
an invalid dataset. Valid accesses should produce the same results as the
current implementation of the project. The results will be tested against
this.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h1>Documentation</h1>
<p>The documentation should describe the parameters being passed into the
function and the format of the returned objects. Inline comments will be used
to describe the actions being taken. These will appear in block comment form
above the function. Smaller comments will be used to explain more complex
operations that may not be wholly self-documented.</p>
<p>Information about the HTTP status codes should be included in the
documentation covering the whole API for this project. This documentation
should also include how to request reports and the expected return value.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementation">
<h1>Implementation</h1>
<div class="section" id="work-items">
<h2>Work Items</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Access Database</p>
<p>The Dataset ID will be used to fetch the comments to be processed. The
cached results will be accessed to check if a report for this dataset,
with matching parameters, has been run previously.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Format Data</p>
<p>The data will need to be re-formatted to match the current input expected
by the analysis module.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Sentiment Analysis</p>
<p>This phase will remain the same as the current implementation.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Format Results</p>
<p>The results of the analysis will also need to be re-formatted. The results
will contain:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Topic Model Dictionary</li>
<li>List of Comment Objects</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The Topic Model will be a dictionary that uses the Topic ID stored in the
comment object as a key that matches a comment to a list of related words.
This list of words is known as a topic.</p>
<p>The comment objects will contain these fields:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Comment</li>
<li>Comment ID</li>
<li>Comment Type</li>
<li>Course</li>
<li>Instructor First Name</li>
<li>Instructor Last Name</li>
<li>Sentiment of Comment</li>
<li>Topic ID</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Return and Cache Results</p>
<p>The results will be store in the database, waiting to be retrieved by the
presentation layer team. The analysis cache will contain the following for
each report:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Number of Topics</li>
<li>Words Per Topic</li>
<li>Iterations</li>
<li>Result Set</li>

<p>Static code analysis needs to be added to the project's review process
to help with code quality and to provide a guideline for coding standards
for the team. The integration of code linting during the commit process
will help reduce the scope of code reviews thereby making them more
effective as a whole. By performing the linting automatically on every
commit, this allows the developers to focus on the substance of the
commit rather than the form and structure.</p>
<div class="section" id="problem-description">
<h1>Problem Description</h1>
<p>As multiple developers write and interact with a code base, the absence
of a unified style will lead to code that is difficult to maintain and
understand. In addition, the absence of an agreed-upon style will lead to
developers wasting time during code reviews to debate stylistic nuances
of the code rather than the content. The appropraite solution for enforcing
style guidelines is to incorporate it with the default commit process used
by the team. Since Arcanist already provides options for pre-commit hooks,
Arcanist needs to be configured to leverage third party linting tools to
enforce code standards automatically. [ArcDiffDoc]</p>

process generates a series of warnings and errors due to formatting
concerns within the code. Arcanist takes these errors and presents them
to the user for correction. Arcanist stops the commit process until the
developer addresses the errors.</dd>

<div class="section" id="proposed-change">
<h1>Proposed Change</h1>
<p>Arcanist's commit process is to be reconfigured to include the use of
automatic linting processes. The linting process is to be configured to
execute Python and JavaScript linting processes.</p>
<p>The following linters shall be configured to execute automatically for
all modified Python files:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">autopep8</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>This linter shall be configured to leverage its auto correct behavior
which will immediately correct any small style concerns without
developer intervention</li>
<li>This linter shall be configured to appropriately enforce pep8 standards
as well as team designated standards without becoming burdensome</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">pydocstyle</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>This linter shall be configured to enforce a unified Python
documentation style.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The jshint shall be configured to execute automatically for
all modified JavaScript files:</p>
<p>All linting configurations shall be properly documented to identify which
settings correspond to which desired behaviors. Configurations shall include
both error and warning settings. Autocorrect behavior shall be implemented
where available. The emphasis will be on correcting common syntax errors,
reducing cyclomatic complexity, and conforming to python standard
code behaviors, particularly those that are unique to the language</p>
<p>The automatic linting feature will work hand-in-hand with the automated
testing feature to comprise the entirety of the pre-commit documentation
and quality evaluation process. The unit testing and linting components
are already independently handled by Arcanist, so the integration process
will be seamless.</p>
<div class="section" id="alternatives">
<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<p>There are multiple third party linting options available for both Python
and JavaScript. A more thorough list of options exists in the
'awesome-static-analysis' repository on GitHub <a class="citation-reference" href="#staticanalysislist" id="id1">[StaticAnalysisList]</a>.
Autopep8, pydocstyle, and jshint were selected for their widespread
adoption and efficiency. Other options can be substituted if found to be
of superior quality, but the options selected represent a sufficient set
of static analysis tools.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h1>Testing</h1>
<p>To properly test the configurations of the linters, Arcanist's linting
command will be executed outside of the commit process to verify that the
linters are working on their own</p>
<p>To test the pre-commit hook, a poorly formatted code file will be submitted
for review in order to trigger the automatic linting process</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h1>Documentation</h1>
